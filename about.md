# Why should you take this course? 
This course will introduce you to the field of cognitive neuroscience, or the study of the neural processes driving cognition (what we think) and behavior (what we do). The overarching goal of this course is to develop your ability to think like a cognitive neuroscientist. This includes understanding the relationship between theory and empiricism, learning how to define a research question, how to design experiments to test hypotheses, how to interpret results, and how to draw conclusions that respect the limitations of the data. 

Within the context of cognitive neuroscience, this course will help you:

* Develop the capacity to critically evaluate research
* Scaffold your own research projects
* Refine your capacity for independent, contextualized thinking
* Satisfy your curiosity about the brain. Maybe you’re a curious person. Maybe you’d like to be a curious person. Either way, welcome!  



## What this course offers
As your instructor, my utmost concern is your learning (i.e. an improvement in your skill level) as opposed to a demonstration of your knowledge. Notice that this definition of learning focuses on change, not performance. Therefore, I prioritize the following: 


* **Conceptual understanding, not rote memorization or reiterating what you already know.** Unlike a neuroanatomy class where verbatim knowledge may be tested, you’ll be expected to reason using the concepts you’ve learned, not repeat their definitions. 
* **Growth.** I’ll provide an opportunity to safely make mistakes and learn from them. You will be rewarded for making mistakes. Yes, you read that correctly. The only way to grow is to try something new.
* **Active learning and collaboration with others.** Time spent in class will often involve applying what you’ve learned in an interactive way (and challenging the things you know). 
* **Evaluating your thought processes, not your conclusions.** If you think about it, your capacity to reason about novel situations using concepts you’ve learned in the past relies on your thought process, not a binary assessment of the validity of your conclusion. So, this course focuses on how you arrive at a conclusion rather than the conclusion itself.  


## What I expect from you
My goal is to make this an effective and supportive learning experience. To this end, the following will be expected of you:

**Be present. Attend class.** In class, be present (not on laptop, phone, etc.). This will ultimately save you time and it’s most effective for learning. There is a no-laptop no-phone policy.

**Be engaged.**  This means reading material in advance when appropriate, thinking about how the material relates to other content, asking the questions you have, and attending to your fellow students when they seek feedback.  

**Ask when you need help.** Everyone needs help at some point. Every single human being. After you’ve exerted a reasonable amount of effort, don’t stay stuck! Instead, please be kind to yourself and ask your questions, whether it be of me or your collaborators.

**Be respectful of me, yourself, and others.** Be considerate of others’ and your own individuality, ideas, time, and energy. 


## What you will do
**Reading and participation** Most classes have assigned reading as preparation for class participation. Reading materials will be posted on Canvas. To jog your thinking, a short answer in response to the reading will be due before each class. This short answer response will count as your reading and participation grade. 

**Quizzes** Up to 10 classes will have pop quizzes testing basic knowledge about the required reading for that class. These will be administered at the beginning of the class when they do happen. Do your reading!

**Final Project** At the end of the semester, you will apply what you’ve learned and engage with the scientific process, including literature review, hypothesis generation, and experimental design. You will present your hypothesized results to the Psychology Department as a poster. Details of this exercise will be given later in the semester.

**Extra credit** To incentivize learning, I will award extra credit to those who demonstrate at least a letter-grade improvement over the semester. I’ll compare grades from the beginning of class to the mid-semester point (1/17-3/2) to grades earned after the mid-semester point to the final day of class (3/2-4/28).
